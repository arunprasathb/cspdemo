Hi Babuji,

As communicated earlier I’m heading off for annual leave starting from 06 January 2020 until 27 January 2020(inclusive) will be not available for this time period but wanted to assure you that I have handed off my works to respective Delegate’s within my team and got approval from client.
 
Any correspondence email sent my way should responded within 2 days of my return.
 
Should you have any questions or need anything, please feel free to contact me via my phone number.
